Oxford Learner's dictionary extension
=============

I want to look up for new word in Oxford Learner's dictionary, but sometimes I'm too lazy to type so I created this extension to auto look up for a word just by double click on it. It's good for saving a few keystrokes but I don't think it's good for remembering the new word. However, have fun using this extension (if anyone happens to use it) ;).
